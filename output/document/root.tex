\title{Maximum Segment Sum}
\author{Nils Cremer}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The \emph{maximum segment sum} problem is to compute, given a list of numbers,
the largest of the sums of the contiguous segments of that list. It is also known
as the \emph{maximum sum subarray} problem and has been considered many times in the literature;
the Wikipedia article ``Maximum subarray problem''\cite{wiki} is a good starting point.

We assume that the elements of the list are not necessarily numbers but just elements
of some linearly ordered additive Abelian group.
